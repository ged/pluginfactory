project_description: |-
  PluginFactory is a mixin module that turns an including class into a factory for
  its derivatives, capable of searching for and loading them by name. This is
  useful when you have an abstract base class which defines an interface and basic
  functionality for a part of a larger system, and a collection of subclasses
  which implement the interface for different underlying functionality.
